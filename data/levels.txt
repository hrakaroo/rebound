This is the readme file for the levels defintion file.  When I get
comments working in the level file I hope to just put these notes 
directly into that file.

The structure of the levels.ldf is as follows

# The title is used to identify the Game, a game is 
#  comprised of a set of levels.  The title paramater
#  at the top of the file gives the title for the game.
#
title = string

# A level definition starts off with the level keyword 
#  with all details for the level between curly braces
level = {

# The title this time refers to the title of the level itself
title = string

# The author refers to the person who designed the level
author = author

# The image is the background image for the level
image = string

# The definition for the board starts with the key word
#  'board' and all row definitions are contained within 
#  curly braces
#
board = {

# Each row is given as a continous string of 24 characters
#  if not all rows are defined then the bottom missing rows
#  are assumed blank.
# The keys for the rows are as follows
#
#  __  blank, no bricks
#  WW  wall, can not break
#  DD  death, touch and die
#  GG  gold, can break with any color ball
#  SS  switch, switches left and right controls
#  B*  brick, the second character describes the color
#  P*  paint, the second character describes the color
#  K*  key, the second character describes the color
#  L*  lock, the second character describes the color
#  *B  brown
#  *C  cobalt
#  *G  green    
#  *O  orange
#  *R  red

# Closing board brace
}

# Closing level brace
}
